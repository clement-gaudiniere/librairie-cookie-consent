# librairie-cookie-consent
Because the users' agreement counts.

This easy-to-use library allows you to ask your users for feedback on various parameters that can be set directly in the code. For more information, see the README documentation. IMPORTANT NOTE: for use with jQuery.

[Demo](https://clement-gaudiniere.github.io/librairie-cookie-consent/)

### How to install it ?

You can download the entire library in three different ways:
- via the library-cookie-consent <a href="https://github.com/clement-gaudiniere/librairie-cookie-consent/releases">release page</a>. 
- via NPM : `npm install librairie-cookie-consent`
- via Bower : <em>Not yet available</em>


### How to use it ?

Before starting any manipulation with the library, the CSS file `popupConsent.css`, the file `popupConsent.js` or `popupConsent.min.js`, and the jQuery framework must be included. For example, our `<head>` could look like this:
``` html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/popupConsent.css">
  <script src="js/popupConsent.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <title></title>
</head>
```

You don't have to include jQuery and `popupConsent.js`/`popupConsent.min.js` between the `<head>` tags, but you must include jquery before `popupConsent.js`/`popupConsent.min.js` and before calling the `popupConsent()` function.

Once these three files are included in our page, , you can create a popup using the `popupConsent();` function.
The question now is how does this function work ? It's actually quite simple, just create a `cookieConsentOptions` variable with an array, like the example below.

``` js
var cookieConsentOptions = {
	// Cookie usage prevention text
	textPopup: 'We use cookies/targeted advertising to ensure you have the best experience on our site. If you continue to use our site, we will assume that you agree to their use. For more information, please see our <a href="#">privacy policy</a>.',
	// The text of the accept button
	textButtonAccept : 'Accept all',
	// The text of the configure my options button
	textButtonConfigure : 'Configuring choices',
	// The text of the save my options button
	textButtonSave : 'Save choices',
	// You can add as many permissions as you like. These permissions can be set in the "configuration" section.
	authorization: [
		// For each authorisation, you must specify its text and the name of its cookie.
		{
			textAuthorization: 'Allow access to geolocation data',
			nameCookieAuthorization: 'autoriseGeolocation'
		},
		{
			textAuthorization: 'Allow personalised ads and content, ad measurement and audience analysis',
			nameCookieAuthorization: 'targetedAdvertising'
		},
		{
			textAuthorization: 'Storing and/or accessing information on a device',
			nameCookieAuthorization: 'cookieConsent'
		}
	]
}
popupConsent(cookieConsentOptions);
```

But how to recover the user's choices? You will see, it's quite simple. The cookie names you specify are stored in the user's browser. If he has accepted all cookies, all cookies will be set to "true". If the user refuses some choices, the cookie will be set to "false".
